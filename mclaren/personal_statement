Conducting postgraduate research has required me to approach multifaceted problems in a logical and structured manner, and provided me with experience in communicating complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. My Ph.D. has had a heavy emphasis in designing and performing experiments, as well as using computers extensively to analyse large amounts of data and solve predictive models. I use MATLAB for the majority of my calculations and take great pleasure in making my (and others') code run as quickly as possible: extensively employing techniques such as vectorisation and using the C extensions (MEX) framework to write time critical routines. I believe that the experience I have gained in the last few years could be extremely useful in a competitive environment where such a language is used. 
 
Formula One is a sport that has always interested me, with my interest intensifying since I began my training in fluid dynamics roughly six years ago. I rapidly became as interested (if not more so) in the engineering behind the cars as the championships and the races themselves. As a result I finally joined the Formula Student racing team here in Cambridge. I became one of a few group leaders taking the jobs of simulating, designing and manufacturing the intake and exhaust, designing the website skeleton, approaching potential sponsors and helping to supervise the rest of the engineering of the car. I found working in such a high-pressure,  environment where team work is essential to be extremely rewarding. Although enjoy working on cutting edge research problems I found that my Ph.D. lacked entirely these aspects and so I have been motivated to move away from academia.
